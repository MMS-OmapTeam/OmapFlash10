 *
 * This file contains the API of a USB driver based on the use of the
 * Texas Instruments OMAP processor ROM code API for access to the USB interface. 
 * This version of the API is compatible with the ROM code API offered
 * for the OMAP3 series of processors, including the OMAP3430 and OMAP3630.
