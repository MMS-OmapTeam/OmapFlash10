-- Development environment for OMAPFlash --

The following tools will be needed in order to work with this source release of OMAPFlash:

1) Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, or
   Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2010 (note that the express version cannot build the installer)

2) Texas Instruments TMS470 Code Generation Tools v4.4.8 (or later) with Code Composer Studio v3.3, or
   Code Composer Studio v4.x with TMS470 that supports Cortex A9. If v4 is used there may be issues with
   path names in the calls to the build system from visual studio - these can be addressed by changing 
   the installation directory of CCS or by modifying the calls in the build system.

   - You can download it from https://www-a.ti.com/downloads/sds_support/CodeGenerationTools.htm#TMS470
   - Set TMS470_HOME system variable to the directory where you installed the TMS470 compiler.
   - If the TMS470_HOME variable is not set, the default location is "C:/Program Files/Texas Instruments/TMS470 Code Generation Tools 4.6.6" directory
   - If "TEMP" user variable is set in your environment, make sure that the directory name doesn't have an white space in it. TMS470 Compiler doesn't like it.

3) ActiveState ActivePerl 1007 or compatible Perl interpreter

   - Set Perl in the System Path.

4) MinGW installation including GNU build tools and MSYS

   - Get MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started
   - Get MSYS from http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS
   - Set MINGW and MSYS bin directories in system PATH variable. e.g.: "C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin"

4) For EMU/HS devices, Texas Instruments MShield-DK with extension providing minimized PPA binary for OMAPFlash (not needed for GP development)


5) For Windows USB driver (WinUSB), Windows driver kit (WDK) is needed. It can be found at:
	
	http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=36a2630f-5d56-43b5-b996-7633f2ec14ff

	Modify projects setting accordingly to the version of WDK downloaded.

6. In Visual Studio Project > Build to build the target image
